A GUI to put your items up for sale for other players on the server to buy. Similar to other auction house / market plugins but for fabric and made by me :)

Permission nodes (change how many chest shops a player can have, based on config option):
"diamondschestshop.infiniteitems"
"diamondschestshop.quintupleitems"
"diamondschestshop.quadrupleitems"
"diamondschestshop.tripleitems"
"diamondschestshop.doubleitems"
"diamondschestshop.halfitems"
"diamondschestshop.noitems"
